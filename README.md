# Mesh Auto Reimport

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that adds a new option to mesh import to reimport the mesh when file changes, letting you to see things change in-game much quicker!
### **Reimport deletes all children of the model, so your in-game changes will be deleted on reimport**
The new option is located in Advanced Settings when importing a model `Reimport when file changes`

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [MeshAutoReimport.dll](https://github.com/TheJebForge/MeshAutoReimport/releases/latest/download/MeshAutoReimport.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
